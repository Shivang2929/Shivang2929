Being a data analyst is one thing… being a **Pokémon data analyst** is another. Imagine trying to calculate trends when your dataset includes:

- Pikachu’s electricity output ⚡  
- Charmander’s flame length 🔥  
- Bulbasaur’s photosynthesis efficiency 🌿  
- Magikarp’s… well, jumping height?  

### Morning
- Coffee ☕  
- Open SQL, Python, and Pokédex CSV all at once.  
- Notice that 42 Pikachu entries have `null` for `Thunderbolt Damage`. Panic ensues.  

### Midday
- Trying to create a scatter plot of Charmander flame length vs. battle victories.  
- Realize half the values are “over 9000” because someone added anime exaggeration.  
- Normalize the data, pray no one notices.  

### Afternoon
- Merge datasets: Pokémon stats + battle history + gym locations.  
- Debug error: Magikarp’s jump height is in meters, Pikachu’s in volts…  
- Cry internally.  

### Evening
- Make a dashboard: top 10 Pokémon by total damage.  
- Coworker asks: “Why is Magikarp number 3?”  
- Me: *Data speaks louder than logic.*

Being a Pokémon data analyst requires patience, creativity, and the ability to explain to your manager why “Ditto can transform into any Pokémon, so yes, it counts as everyone.”  

Remember: behind every clean Pokémon dataset, there’s a data analyst silently praying that Team Rocket doesn’t corrupt the database.
