### Your brain is powerful but only if your body is on your side.

People will tell you:  
- Learn **Python** to grow.  
- Master **SQL** to get a better job.  
- Build **projects** to stand out.  

All great advice.  

But here’s the truth I’ve learned through experience:  
**Before any of that… you have to learn how to take care of yourself.**

### Burnout doesn’t start with code  
It starts when you forget that your body and mind need maintenance too.  

I’ve seen it in myself, in students, and in coworkers:  
- Skipping sleep.  
- Living on caffeine.  
- Pushing through stress.  
- Promising to rest *“after the next project.”*  

And then one day, nothing works — not your focus, not your energy, not even your code.

### The most important skill in tech  
💡 **Treat your body like your first machine, and your mind like your main engine.**  

- Fuel them.  
- Update them.  
- Give them recovery time.  

✔️ Take real breaks  
✔️ Move a little every day  
✔️ Sleep like your career depends on it (because it does)  
✔️ Say no to what drains your battery  
✔️ Say yes to what makes you feel alive

### Final thought  
Learning Python, SQL, and building projects will help you grow.  
But your energy, health, and mindset?  
That’s the **foundation everything else is built on.** 🚀
