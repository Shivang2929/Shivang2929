Being a data analyst is like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, we solve mysteries like:

- Why does this Excel file have 1,024 sheets?  
- Who changed the column name from `Revenue` to `Revnue`… in production?  
- Why is the sum of the parts greater than the total?  

Here’s a typical day in the life:

### Morning
- Coffee ☕  
- Open SQL, Python, and Excel all at once (because why not juggle three languages before 9 AM?)  
- Realize the database has missing values. Panic ensues.

### Midday
- Dashboards, charts, and graphs!  
- Spend 45 minutes deciding if a bar chart should be horizontal or vertical.  
- Coworker asks: “Can you make it pop?”  
- Me: *Sure… with rainbow colors and Comic Sans?*

### Afternoon
- Data cleaning: the never-ending story.  
- Convert `N/A`, `null`, `-`, `missing`, and `???` into actual NULL values.  
- Write a SQL query so elegant, it deserves a Nobel Prize.  

### Evening
- Review reports, send emails, feel accomplished.  
- Realize you forgot to update the date filter. All charts are wrong.  
- Cry a little.  
- Repeat tomorrow.

Being a data analyst isn’t just numbers, charts, or queries. It’s patience, humor, and a love for finding answers where others see chaos.

Remember: behind every clean dataset, there’s a data analyst silently praying that no one asks “Why are these numbers slightly off?”
